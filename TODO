	Color dictionary optimizer (e.g. taking redundant definitions like {1:(green),2:(green)})
	
	Better ignore capabilities: pass client object to ignorer functions?
	
	Add listinput methods to bind resize/enter functions
	
	Make daemonized threads stop with entire program
	
	Stacktrace random segfaults
